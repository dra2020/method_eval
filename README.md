# method_eval

The purpose of this project is to evaluate John Nagle's composite elections, inferred S(V) curves, and fractional seat probabilities methodology,
as implemented in Dave's Redistricting (aka DRA2020).

Research questions:

- How well do the S(V) curves inferred from our composite elections track actual 2022 election results?
- How well do the seat probabilities derived from actual district D vote shares track actual D seat wins (and losses)?

- What is the SEM of the inferred S(V) curves around mean statewide D vote share (+/â€“ 2%)? <<< TODO: What should this range be?
- [TODO: The Moon issue -- Metrics on composite elections (average of elections) vs. average of metrics on individual elections]
